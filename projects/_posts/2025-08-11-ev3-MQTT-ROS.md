üöÄ **Learn, build, and control!**  
This project is designed for students, researchers, and robotics enthusiasts who want to explore mobile robot teleoperation using real hardware and industry-standard tools. By combining **ROS**, **MQTT**, and **LEGO EV3**, it offers a practical way to understand robotics concepts, sensor integration, and simulation‚Äîall in one package.

## üìö About the Project

Hi, my name is **Juan Sebasti√°n Daleman**. I am a graduate student at **Universidad Nacional de Colombia**, based in Bogot√° D.C., Colombia.  
This project was developed as part of the *Fundamentals of Mobile Robotics* postgraduate course, within the [Labsir](https://github.com/labsir-un) research group. It is an open-source initiative aimed at exploring mobile robotics using professional tools such as **ROS** to control and process various sensors, while also simulating robot behavior in a virtual environment.

## ‚ú® Features

- üíª **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works on Linux (native), Windows via WSL, or Raspberry Pi.  
- üì° **Sensor integration**: Supports the LEGO EV3 gyro sensor, with potential for ultrasonic, color, and touch sensors.  
- üéÆ **Custom teleoperation interface**: Control the robot using a keyboard, joystick, or GUI via rqt plugin.  
- üîó **MQTT broker flexibility**: Compatible with HiveMQ, Mosquitto, or local MQTT brokers.  
- üñ• **Simulation and visualization**: Full support for RViz and Gazebo with 3D robot models.  
- ‚ö° **QoS and latency optimization**: Adjustable MQTT Quality of Service and network tuning for low-latency control.  
- üõ† **Extensibility**: Modular ROS node structure to easily add new sensors, actuators, or behaviors.  
- üéì **Educational focus**: Designed for learning ROS, MQTT, and robotics in academic or hobbyist contexts.  
- üìä **Logging and monitoring**: Record and review robot data using rosbag or MQTT logs.  
- üåê **Remote deployment**: Send and run code on the EV3 over SSH without a physical connection.
